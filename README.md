# Portfolio

This repository is a way to know my work and complement my resume.
I will simulate existing problems in companies and the solutions needed to solve such problems, focusing on the business and decision making.
Therefore, my goal is not to present the most complex challenges using strictly technical codes and language, but rather how I would behave in such situations.
Obviously, when necessary, I will present codes and also explain the methodology used.
Any questions, don't hesitate to contact me (email: lndoxmat@hotmail.com).
Thank you for your consideration,
Leandro Duarte
